# GA-PII-Project
This project is supposed to sift through ga data and pick out all of the pieces of data that could contain Personal Identifiable Information.

## Current State
Still a big WIP. Currently, this program is only able to authenticate to ga and do a very basic api call.

Talk to Abdul or Christian to learn more.
